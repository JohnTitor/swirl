Swirl
=====

A simple, efficient background work queue for Rust
--------------------------------------------------

Swirl is a background work queue built on Diesel and PostgreSQL's row locking
features. It was extracted from [crates.io](crates.io), which uses it for
updating the index off the web server.

This crate is still a work in progress, please check back in a few weeks.
